# csstdg5figs

This repository contains the files used to create the figures for _CSS: The Definitive Guide, 5th Edition_.  I mostly did this by loading them up in Firefox OS X and using the `:screenshot` console utility (see “[Firefox’s :screenshot command](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2018/08/24/firefoxs-screenshot-command-2018/)” for more information)—except in the rare cases where Firefox didn’t support the thing I was illustrating, in which case I used Chrome OS X set to somewhere around 200%–500% zoom.

## Notes

* If you want an easy-to-browse version, load the repo-root-level `index.html` in a web browser and surf from there.  NOTE: some files have to be served over HTTP in order to avoid CORS restrictions.  Also [available on GitHub Pages](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/).
